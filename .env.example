# Hugging Face Authentication Credentials
# Rename this file to .env and fill in your credentials

# Hugging Face API Token (REQUIRED)
# This token is required for accessing the Hugging Face Inference API and Spaces
# Get your token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
HF_TOKEN=your_token_here

# 3D Model Generation Space (REQUIRED)
# You must choose and duplicate ONE of the following spaces to your Hugging Face account:
#
# Option 1: InstantMesh Space
# Duplicate from: https://huggingface.co/spaces/tencentARC/InstantMesh
# Example value: your-username/InstantMesh
#
# Option 2: Hunyuan3D-2 Space
# Duplicate from: https://huggingface.co/spaces/tencent/Hunyuan3D-2
# Example value: your-username/Hunyuan3D-2
#
# IMPORTANT: Duplicating a space to your own account allows you to:
# 1. Avoid GPU quota limitations that affect shared spaces
# 2. Have dedicated resources for your 3D model generation
# 3. Control access and privacy settings
#
# Format must be "username/space-name" (e.g., "your-username/InstantMesh")
# After duplicating, your space URL will be: https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/SpaceName
# But you should only enter "your-username/SpaceName" in this variable
#
# NOTE: The application will automatically detect which space you've duplicated
# based on the endpoints available in the space.
MODEL_SPACE=your-username/InstantMesh

# Optional: Port for SSE transport (default: 3000)
